# Build status

Last design review: **2026-07-21**

| Milestone | State | Last validation | Known issues | Next action | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 — Frozen design packet | complete | Required-file, link, fence, architecture, scope, and consistency checks passed | Deployment/video/commit placeholders remain, as expected before implementation | Create the initial documentation commit and open the primary Codex session | `<initial-docs-commit>` |
| M1 — Repository and reproducible environment | complete | `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run validate` passed 2026-07-21 | GitHub CLI metadata/API access remains unavailable, but Git push succeeds | Maintain the reproducible baseline | `9e78db4`, evidence `0259e48` |
| M2 — Deployable vertical slice | complete | Local validation, production desktop/mobile smoke, and GitHub Actions validate/deploy passed 2026-07-21 | `gh` CLI API auth is invalid, but public Actions API and Git push work | Keep production healthy while implementing M3 | `7d7f276`, evidence `1ccf238` |
| M3 — Reversible interpreter core | complete | Full M3 command matrix and `bun run validate` passed 2026-07-21 | Optional callback array methods remain intentionally cut per M3 fallback | Preserve runtime invariants while building the table framework | `f902c0a` |
| M4 — Table framework and complete deterministic sample | complete | Local validation, production desktop/mobile gameplay, and GitHub Actions validate/deploy passed 2026-07-21 | Pixi bundle emits a non-blocking >500 kB chunk warning | Preserve the deterministic game while adding server-side AI | `e5732aa` |
| M5 — GPT-5.6 integration | complete | Local/live validation, production desktop/mobile paths, and GitHub Actions validate/deploy passed 2026-07-21 | None known beyond the existing Pixi bundle warning | Preserve validated AI and fallback behavior in the hero flow | `aab81ed` |
| M6 — Complete hero/judge flow | complete | Local validation, CI, exact production version, live AI path, and deployed desktop/mobile checks passed 2026-07-21 | None known beyond the existing Pixi bundle warning | Preserve the literal judge path while adding persistence | `405fe3a` |
| M7 — Persistent shared rooms and rebase | complete | Local validation, CI, exact production version, two-browser convergence/reload/fork passed 2026-07-21 | None known beyond the existing bundle warning | Preserve ordering and capability boundaries during hardening | `d9ebcda` |
| M8 — Reliability, mobile, security, and production verification | in progress | Local/CI validation, apex exact-version smoke, 36-check production E2E, M7 rollback, and M8 restore passed 2026-07-21 | CI smoke URL follow-up must pass | Commit canonical URL fix, push, and verify CI/apex | `51dc131` |
| M9 — Evidence and release freeze | not started | — | No real evidence yet | Fill evidence, record video, tag release, submit | — |

## Current gate

**M8 IN PROGRESS.** The local and clean CI hardening matrices are green. The
canonical apex passed exact-version/header smoke and all 36 production browser
checks; rollback served exact M7, and restored M8 is again at 100% traffic. The
first deploy job's smoke exposed that workers.dev is retired after custom-domain
assignment. The final gate is to push the apex URL correction and verify its CI
deployment/smoke before marking M8 complete.

## Cut line

If time is critically constrained after M6, preserve the complete single-room
judge path and cut M7 collaboration polish before weakening the interpreter,
GPT-5.6 validation, complete game, deployment, or evidence.
